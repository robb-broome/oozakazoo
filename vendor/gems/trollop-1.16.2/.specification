description: |-
  Trollop is a commandline option parser for Ruby that just
  gets out of your way. One line of code per option is all you need to write.
  For that, you get a nice automatically-generated help page, robust option
  parsing, command subcompletion, and sensible defaults for everything you don't
  specify.
